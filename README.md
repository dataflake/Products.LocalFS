Local File System product
==========================

This product allows you to serve files and browse directories from the 
local file system (or network shares on Windows platforms). It also
allows you to upload files to the file system trough a browser and FTP.
 
The documentation for this product is maintained by Sphinx
using sources underneath the ``docs`` folder.

To get started without the compiled HTML documentation see the 
file ``docs/development.rst``
